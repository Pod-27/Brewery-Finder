- **Market:** Every single day, youths in the United States are turning 21 and for the first time in their lives, they can go out to drink - legally at least. Our app is solely for the youth who want to devote a good amount of time to find out if alcohol is really for them or not. The app is well positioned to give the name and location of the nearest brewery. That way, they can go out and explore and hopefully be able to buy alcohol from the source and that for their friends who are a few months away from turning 21.

- **Scope:** The brewery finder app is a mobile application that helps users locate and explore breweries in their local area or in a specific city. Users can search for breweries based on location, beer type, and other relevant criteria, and view a list of nearby breweries with their ratings, hours of operation, and other relevant information. The app also includes a map view that shows the locations of nearby breweries, and users can click on a brewery to view more detailed information, save their favorite breweries, and filter the brewery list based on their preferences. The app is free to download and use, and aims to provide a simple and user-friendly way for beer enthusiasts to discover new breweries and plan their outings.
